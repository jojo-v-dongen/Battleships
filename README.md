The computer will randomly pick a spot on this grid to place their ship.
The program will ask the user where they want to place their ship.
When an incorrect placement is submit, the program will direct the user to enter a correct placement.

The user and computer take turns guessing the placement of the opponents ship, the computer will do so purely random.
If the guess of either the player or computer is correct it will indicate the winner with the placement of both ships.
If the gues of the player or the computer is wrong, it will indicate it by showing "MISS".

### TODO
- Make multiple ships with different sizes and therby also make the grid larger.
- Make the game graphically-based instead of text-based.
- Make the computer slightly less random and smarter by not allowing guesses which already have been guessed.
